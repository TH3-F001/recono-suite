# recono-suite

## Install:
    Note that at this time this has only been tested with fedora. I want to set it up so it's
    running from a Virtual Environment in the ~/.config/recono-suite directory, but right now
    I simply Lack the Patience.

### Clone the repository and enter the directory:
    git clone git@github.com:TH3-F001/recono-suite.git
    cd recono-suite

### Install setup.py requirements:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the setup.py script (requires python 3.10 or higher)
    python setup.py
    # this will eventually be replaced by an install.sh script which does everything along with 
    # creating the virtual environment. For now... I just want to enumerate some subdomains man.
    # I'm happy with what I have. But I know it could be MUCH better
