# recono-suite

## Description
Just a shitty little collection of scripts for enumerating seed domains, subdomains, and directories for bug bounty
All they do for the most part is multi-processed, and multi-threaded execution of common recon shell commands, send the output to a
common directory, and then parses the results to a master file, which is then iterated over again until no new results are
found

### Tools Used:

#### Subdomain Enumeration:
- Amass
- Bbot
- C99
- crt.sh
- GoBuster
- Github-Subdomains
- Hakrawler
- Knockpy
- ShoSubGo
- Subfinder
- Subdomainizer
- Waybackurls
